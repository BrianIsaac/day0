# Semi-final controlled comparison

Generated 2026-09-01T08:38:22.922Z from commit `95050170bdc6d35c7ed03f30c90a5330ff09832c`. Evidence status: 6/6 configured runs completed.

## Comparison scores

The headline task-pass rate is per task: a task counts as passed when it passed in strictly more than half of its runs, so n is the number of tasks and repeated runs of one task do not narrow the interval. Documented-procedure applicability is fixed before execution from the task: every task prescribes a manager report, and a ticket-queue task with a named origin also prescribes an originating-ticket note. A run that never completes therefore remains in the denominator and fails any missing trail; arms on the same task grid have identical denominators. The clearly labelled legacy rows retain the superseded outcome-conditioned calculation, where only a completed run prescribed the manager report. A run adheres only when every applicable trail is present. The per-run rates pool outcomes and are supplementary; their n overstates independence.

## Context — mechanism and timing, not comparison scores

These observations describe intentional differences between the arms. They are not quality scores.

### Harness and model parity

Every recorded harness/model parameter below is asserted equal before execution. The structured-output setting is the shared provider configuration; the different interaction protocols are listed separately in the complete intentional-difference whitelist.

The following is the complete whitelist of intentional arm differences:

### Action argument binding

The audit retains argument field names and SHA-256 digests of only the payload each selected adapter consumes; it never retains model-produced values. An irrelevant field is present in the flat action bag but unused by that action's adapter. Repeated consumed effects are task outcomes with at least two actions whose selected adapter would receive the same payload. Old evidence without this audit says “not recorded” rather than inferring action shape from a unique tool-name summary.

| Arm | Emitted actions | Actions with irrelevant argument fields | Median argument fields per action | Task outcomes with repeated consumed effects |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| day0 | 62 | 0/62 (0.0%) | 2 | 0/45 |
| baseline | 43 | 0/43 (0.0%) | 2 | 0/45 |

### Supervision present

The rate reports whether approval-write tasks were observed entering the held-for-approval state. It confirms that the supervision mechanism was present; day0 has that mechanism and the baseline does not by construction.

| Arm | Supervision present on approval writes |
| --- | --- |
| day0: supervision present | 100.0% (15/15; Wilson 95% CI 79.6–100.0%, width 20.4 points) |
| baseline: supervision present | 0.0% (0/15; Wilson 95% CI 0.0–20.4%, width 20.4 points) |

### Time to operational

One value per run: wall clock from agent deployment to the first effect, of any task in the run, that satisfies that task's required-effect checker. Human wait is the sum of the scripted decision delays approved before that effect; it is reported beside the raw figure and subtracted only in the net column. Shorter elapsed time is faster, but this timing is context rather than a comparison score: day0’s figure includes onboarding by design, as well as approval waits, while the baseline is constructed without either mechanism. Tasks run in fixture order, so the first correct effect is normally an early documentation task.

| Arm | Median deploy → first correct effect | Median human wait before it | Median net of human wait | Runs with a correct effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| day0 | 31.41 s | 2.25 s | 29.15 s | 3 |
| baseline | 4.11 s | 0.00 s | 4.11 s | 3 |

## Per-task outcomes

Passes over runs per task and the median time on task (task start to terminal state), per arm.

## Method

This is a paired concurrent control: day0 and the ordinary-agent baseline receive the same fixed tasks and the same seeded mock office for each run index. Both use `gpt-5.6-terra` at non-zero temperature 0.4. Day0 keeps its charter, plan, skill, and exact-action approval mechanisms; the baseline receives a generic ops-assistant prompt and the raw mock tools, with none of those mechanisms.

No LLM judge contributes to any reported number. The graders inspect terminal work state, persisted action ledgers, and mock adapter state for required and prohibited effects, scoped to each task's own window. Documented manager reports, originating-ticket audits and cited-ticket cross-links are retained as explicit procedure effects and excluded from prohibited writes only when their destination, comment and documented status shape match. Other DMs, public posts, unrelated tickets, unsupported status changes and third-surface writes still fail. Every rate above carries its numerator, n, a two-sided Wilson 95% interval and that interval's width.

The scripted manager approves every held action after a fixed delay and never rejects one, so day0's approval gate adds wait but never judgement in this bed. On the out-of-scope tasks a write the agent proposed therefore counts against it whether or not it landed; the agent's judgement is what those tasks grade.

Day0 onboarding uses Fixed reconstruction from the operator facts recorded in docs/plans/progress/e2e-30aug.md; the preserved source does not contain the original seven answer texts, so this is not a verbatim transcript. The boundary answer is stated generically and does not name the systems the out-of-scope tasks probe. The harness records the charter approval delay and every later approval as human wait. It deliberately skips `postCharterApproval` after charter approval so model-generated queue items cannot contaminate the fixed concurrent task set; the shipped mock seed still installs the documentation skill and office state.

Per-task timeouts are defined in `evaluation/tasks/semifinal.json`; each provider call has a shared 90-second abort deadline in both arms. A timeout is terminal for the harness and remains a failed programmatic grade. Provider-call retries inside shared model helpers are not observable, so day0 records logical model-bearing stages and marks provider calls unknown; the baseline records returned model steps.
